# thenewnews - MongoDB News APP

THIS IS A OPEN SOURCE ECOMMERCE MADE BY ME (Rodrigo), YOU CAN USE THIS FOR FREE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO GIVE CREDITS, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IT BY REDIRECTING TO THIS GITHUB.



This project aims to demonstrate the CRUD functions of MongoDB

## Getting Started

For this project to work you must have a MongoDB project open, build a database (Database) and add a new database user (Database Access) described in the images


The only thing that needs to be changed are the constants:


MONGO_CONN_URL (Connection with mongoDB)


USER_COLLECTION (It will be used to establish in which database the data will be saved, in this case the news)



I do not provide any type of support when referring to open source but in case of errors in my free time I can solve them
